# 🔒 Working Sample: ICMP Flood Attack Analysis (NIST Cybersecurity Framework)

This repository contains a practical working sample in the field of cybersecurity. It simulates a DDoS attack using ICMP packets and demonstrates structured incident handling based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

## 📘 About the Project

- Scenario: Simulated ICMP flood attack disrupting internal network communication
- Objective: Apply the five core NIST functions — Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- Focus: Practical cybersecurity analysis using real-world methods

## 📁 Files Included

- 'Working_Sample_Cybersecurity_NIST' – English version of the full NIST-based analysis
- 'Arbeitsprobe_Cybersecurity_NIST' – German version
- 'glossary' – Embedded in each document for reference


## 🛠️ Topics Covered

- ICMP traffic analysis and rate limiting
- Intrusion Detection Systems (e.g. Snort)
- Access control and network segmentation
- Real-time monitoring (SIEM)
- Structured incident response and recovery planning

## 📌 Purpose

This project was created as part of my personal preparation for a dual study program in Computer Science with a focus on cybersecurity. It reflects my technical interest, structured thinking, and motivation to contribute to secure digital systems.
