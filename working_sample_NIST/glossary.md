## 📘 Glossary – Key Terms in this Working Sample

### 🛡️ DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
A coordinated cyberattack that overwhelms a network or system with massive amounts of traffic, making it unusable. It is often executed using many distributed devices.

---

### 📶 ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
A network protocol used for diagnostic and error messages. Commonly used for "ping" requests but can be exploited for DDoS attacks via flooding.

---

### 🔥 Firewall Rule (Rate Limiting)
A configuration that limits the number of allowed requests per time unit. In ICMP flooding, this helps prevent system overload.

---

### 🧱 Network Segmentation
Dividing a network into multiple logical or physical sections (e.g. VLANs) to improve control and contain attacks.

---

### 🔐 Access Control
Policies and mechanisms to restrict user/system access to resources. Helps minimize unnecessary traffic and attack surfaces.

---

### 📡 IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention System)
Tools for detecting (IDS) or actively blocking (IPS) malicious traffic. They monitor network data for suspicious patterns.

---

### 📊 SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
A centralized platform for collecting, analyzing, and correlating security-relevant log data. Enables real-time detection and response.

---

### 📈 Network Monitoring
The ongoing observation of network activity to identify abnormal behavior, spikes, or signs of compromise.

---

### 💡 NIST Cybersecurity Framework
A widely used framework for organizing cybersecurity activities into five main categories: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.
